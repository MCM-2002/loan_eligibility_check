# loan_eligibility_check
The notebook is structured to load loan data from CSV files, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prepare the data for machine learning models. The dataset contains information about loan applicants, including features like gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, credit history, and loan status. The notebook uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Key Steps in the Notebook:
Data Loading: The notebook loads training and testing datasets (loan-train.csv and loan-test.csv) using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook performs initial data exploration by displaying the first few rows of the dataset, checking for missing values, and generating summary statistics.

Data Visualization: The notebook uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations such as pair plots to understand the relationships between different features.

Data Cleaning: The notebook checks for missing values and describes the dataset's structure and statistics.

Machine Learning Preparation: The notebook prepares the data for machine learning by handling missing values and exploring the dataset's distribution.
